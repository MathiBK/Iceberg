## Iceberg

Iceberg is a 2D roguelite platformer that aims to make the least satisfying part of
many video games, failing, more interactive and fun for the player. The goal of the
game is for the player to fight their way through different enemies while dodging
obstacles, and eventually reaching the end of the level, which will take them further
down the iceberg.

When planning the game, we wanted to make an effort to make failing feel less bad
for the player, by giving them control over the difficulty by adding abilities gained
from dying.
